                     <h3>Computers</h3>
                     <p>At the moment I am doing a course about "How to create Website's and design them". I'm really interested and I think I might could do that as a job in the futur. I although like gaming especially with my friends and live on Twitch. It's so much fun, and it can save a whole day. If I had more time I would try to run an active TikTok and YouTube Channel. </p>

                     <h3>Motorcycling</h3>
                     <p>I love Motorcycles the way they look and sound impressed me since I was a child and now in Paraguay I finally can ride my Motorcycle. It's not the fastest but for the beginning it's very good. When I'm good enough I can ride my fathers Motorcycle. It's a Suzuki Dakar 650 and I really want to ride it because it's so beautiful and fast and i want an upgrade from my Kenton Dakar 200.</p>
